Brainfuck in go
Brainfuck compiler in Go - well not quite. A compiler outputs binaries. It's in between an interpreter and a compiler.

Intro
This is the possible implementation of a Brainfuck interpreter by any means. Nor it is the fastest.

The goal from this was to learn a bit about how interpreters and compilers work. Using Brainfuck looked to be the simplest way to achieve this.
